# Firefox preconfigured to works with Cisco WebEx

This is bunch of scripts to make DEB package containing 32-bit Firefox and JRE 1.7.

It made for my own needs and tested only on my Ubuntu 16.04.

# Build

To build DEB package, you will need to download into `./dl/` directory a `tar.gz` archive with `jre_1.7` from Oracle site.

Then just run `make` command.
